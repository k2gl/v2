## ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING - READ BEFORE EDITING ⚠️

**THIS FILE IS SAFETY-CRITICAL:**

1. **NEVER ADD REAL API KEYS, TOKENS, OR PASSWORDS**
   Even though this file is gitignored, manual errors can happen.

2. **IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY COMMIT SECRETS:**
   - Run `git log --check` to find the commit
   - Rotate all exposed credentials immediately
   - Use `.gitattributes` protection

3. **SAFE ALTERNATIVES FOR SECRETS:**
   - Use `.env` files (already gitignored)
   - Use environment variables
   - Use your system's keychain (macOS Keychain, GNOME Keyring)

4. **RENAMING PROTECTION:**
   If you rename this file to something else, update `.gitattributes`:
   ```
   your-new-filename filter=error-on-secrets
   ```

**Remember:** The `.gitattributes` file provides extra protection, but it's not a substitute for careful practices.
